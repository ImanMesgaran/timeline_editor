## TimelineEditor
Main widget used to hold your tracks, display position and time

## TimelineEditorTrack
A provided track to use with the **TimelineEditor** track builder (you can use your own)

It can either hold simple **TimelineEditorBox** with a start and an end

or TimelineEditorTrack.fromContinuous with **TimelineEditorContinuousBox** to have a conitunuous track where you only set start time and duration will be calculated so the box go up to the next box
